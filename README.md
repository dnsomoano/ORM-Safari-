We are taking a surprise trip to the Savannah for a safari to see all sorts of exotic animals. During our time their we want to keep track of all the animals we have seen. For this, we need to create a database, as well as a small console application to help record what we see. 


## Objectives

* Use an ORM to query against a database

## Requirements


### Explorer Mode

* [ ] Create a database called `SafariVacation` / `safari_vacation`
    * [ ] This will have 1 table called `SeenAnimals` / `seen_animals` that has the following columns
        - `Id` / `id` (int)
        - `Species` /  `species` (string)
        - `CountOfTimesSeen` / `count_of_times_seen` (int)
        - `LocationOfLastSeen` / `location_of_last_seen` (string)
    - NOTE: This should be made all in the code (C#/Ruby), and **not** created in the `pgcli`.
* [ ] Create a small console application, and create the following queries using your languages ORM.
    * [ ] Display all animals the user has seen
    * [ ] Update the `CountOfTimesSeen`  and `LocationOfLastSeen` for an animal
    * [ ] Display all animals seen in the `Jungle`
    * [ ] Remove all animals that I have seen in the `Desert`. 
    * [ ] Add all the `CountOfTimesSeen` and get a total number of animals seen
    * [ ] Get the `CountOfTimesSeen` of `lions`, `tigers` and `bears`
    


### Adventure Mode

* [ ] Add a new column called `LastSeenTime`, with a type of DateTime. This will require a new migration to added and ran.


### Epic Mode

* [ ] Continue to make progress on your capstone project.
